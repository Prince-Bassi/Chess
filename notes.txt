Piece object- It will have its own color, its own type like bishop or king. It will have a function to 
calculate what squares it can go to. Which means i would need to access the nearby squares to the square of the piece.
like in the knight's moves. That could be done since i have the row elements like a, b, c. The killing function
can probably be handled in the square object. For the king, i would need to find out when its about to be killed.
though, i have to figure out a lot before that so leave it.

Square object- It will handle clicks of course. Its states can be 'selected' or not to see if we are clicking to
move a piece or to access one. If its not already selected, its for selecting a piece, if its already selected, its for
moving a piece. Esc key would de-select all but thats a function of the game object.

So, i could make use of Piece objects which would control how the squares are selected since different pieces
would select different squares. So when the square is clicked, it will trigger the function of its piece to send the
main game object a signal to select the squares that it calculated according to its type of piece. Then the squares 
will light up to indicate selection and in the Square object, if a square is clicked while its been selected, it will
send the selected squared which would be stored in the main game object to and move the piece from it to itself.
the selected square's piece will be empty and it would be de-selected. Now here, we can handle the killing function
if the square which has been cliked had a piece on it, that piece will die and the selected square's piece will
take its place.
